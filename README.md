# Implementing-a-Neural-Network-from-Scratch
I will implement a simple 3-layer neural network from scratch.

I am learning from this repository:
1- what is the neural network?
2- how the neural network is working?
3- what are forward pass and backward pass?
4- what is gradient descent?
5- what are the softmax, cost function, and Cross-Entropy?
6- what are the activation functions and different types of it?
7- what are overfitting and underfitting?
